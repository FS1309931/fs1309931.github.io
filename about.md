# About Me
Hello! I am FS.
I want to have my career as a Soccer goalkeeper professionaly. My dream since I was younge at the age of 4 years old was inspired by my Grandpa he was one of the many goalkeepers that were going to make it proffessionally but messed up their body. I want to be the one that he gets to see in the higher leuges of soccer. The desire and hunger I have for this carreer is unmatched. 

My career at the moment I am going for is a professional soccer goalkeeper because this is the career that I had pursued for since I was 4 and later on into the career I got asked to go to Spain and didn’t have a chance to go due to personal issues and so I’m hoping to get another opportunity. If this career goes south I would want to work in automotives or something like HVAC.
How does it connect to your lifestyle goals?
Because I would complete the dream I had since I was a little kid and I'd have the funds I want to be able to have that I want to have.
